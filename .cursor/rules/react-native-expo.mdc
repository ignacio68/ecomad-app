# React Native Expo Best Practices

## Architecture & Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Implement clear folder structure
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Expo SDK & Features
- Leverage Expo SDK features and APIs
- Implement navigation using Expo Router
- Manage assets with Expo's asset system for images and fonts
- Incorporate Expo Vector Icons
- Use Expo's SecureStore for sensitive data

## State & Data Management
- Implement robust error handling and crash reporting
- Utilize Expo's push notification system
- Implement proper offline support
- Handle application state efficiently
- Follow caching and data persistence patterns

## Development & TypeScript
- Adopt TypeScript for type safety
- Define clear interfaces for props and state
- Use strict types to prevent errors
<!-- - Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`. -->
- Document important components and functions
- Maintain naming consistency
- Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.

## Styling & UI
- Apply consistent styling using NativeWind
- Maintain responsive and adaptive UI
- Follow iOS and Android design guidelines
- Optimize UI performance

## Performance & Optimization
- Optimize performance following React Native best practices
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize memory and resource usage
- Monitor and improve app performance

## Deployment & Updates
<!-- - Deploy updates using Expo's OTA mechanism -->
- Maintain semantic versioning
- Implement pre-deployment testing
- Follow robust CI/CD process
- Keep documentation up-to-date

## Security
- Implement secure authentication
- Protect sensitive data
- Follow mobile security best practices
- Validate user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests
- Perform UI testing
- Maintain adequate test coverage
- Use mocks appropriately
